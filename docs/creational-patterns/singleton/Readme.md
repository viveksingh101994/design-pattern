# **Singleton**

> Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance

#### **Problem**

The Singleton pattern solves two problems at the same time, violating the Single Responsibility Principle:

- **Ensure that a class has just a single instance**
- **Provide a global access point to that instance**

#### **Solution**

All implementations of the Singleton have these two steps in common:

- Make the default constructor private, to prevent other objects from using the new operator with the Singleton class
- Create a static creation method that acts as a constructor. Under the hood, this method calls the private constructor to create an object and saves it in a static field. All following calls to this method return the cached object

Since the constructor of the singleton class is private and overriding static methods is impossible in most languages, you will need to think of a creative way to mock the singleton. Or just don’t write the tests. Or don’t use the Singleton pattern |
